## Welcome to Dshek Fashions

The fashion design career, has recently emerged as one of the most popular and competitive among young people. 
Those who actually succeed in design have a very individualistic personal style and don’t follow trends set by others. 
Having fashion design as your profession sometimes allows you to meet glamorous people. 




### Fashion is not necessarily about labels. It’s not about brands. It’s about something else that comes from within you” -Ralph Lauren (“Glamour” 1). Fashion designers are artists who work in apparel retails and other wholesale or manufacturing establishments, who create and design original apparel with their artistic abilities. These designers need an abundant amount of skills, such as active listening, critical thinking, active learning, coordination, and decision making, social perceptiveness, and more.
